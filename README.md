## 📖 Abstract

We present **WaveFormer**, a novel framework capable of reconstructing dense, temporally consistent 3D sea surfaces from standard video captured by monocular cameras. Unlike rigid terrain, water surfaces are optically complex and lack static features; our method solves this persistent photogrammetric challenge without requiring cumbersome stereo rigs.
